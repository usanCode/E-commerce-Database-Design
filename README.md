# E-commerce-Database-Design

 
 The aim of this current project is to design a database for 
an E-commerce plateform. 

For this purpose, tables that determine 
all transactions that can be carried out have to be implemented
 and all the relationships 
 between all the tables in the database have to be established as well.

##🗃️ Tables to Be Created

You'll be building the following tables for your e-commerce platform 🛍️:

🖼️ ***product_image*** – Stores product image URLs or file references

🎨 ***color*** – Manages available color options

🗂️ ***product_category*** – Classifies products into categories (e.g., clothing, electronics)

📦 ***product*** – Stores general product details (name, brand, base price)

🧾 ***product_item*** – Represents purchasable items with specific variations

🏷️ ***brand*** – Stores brand-related data

🔄 ***product_variation*** – Links a product to its variations (e.g., size, color)

📏 ***size_category*** – Groups sizes into categories (e.g., clothing sizes, shoe sizes)

📐 ***size_option*** – Lists specific sizes (e.g., S, M, L, 42)

🧵 ***product_attribute*** – Stores custom attributes (e.g., material, weight)

📚 ***attribute_category*** – Groups attributes into categories (e.g., physical, technical)

🧪 ***attribute_type*** – Defines types of attributes (e.g., text, number, boolean)

The PDF document  [Ecommerce Database Relationships](documents/Ecommerce Database Relationships.pdf) is also available in which relationships between the tables 
are clearly visualized.
